/*
 * SELECTION EXERCISE 8:
 * The number of lines that can be printed on a piece of paper depends on the paper size, the
 * point size of each character in a line, whether lines are double-spaced or single-spaced, the
 * top and bottom margin, and the left and right margins of the paper. Assume that all
 * characters are of the same point size, and all lines are either single-spaced or double-
 * spaced. Note that 1 inch Â¼ 72 points. Moreover, assume that the lines are printed along the
 * width of the paper. For example, if the length of the paper is 11 inches and the width is 8.5
 * inches, then the maximum length of a line is 8.5 inches. Write a program that calculates the
 * number of characters in a line and the number of lines that can be printed on a paper based
 * on the following input from the user:

 * a. The length and width, in inches, of the paper.
 * b. The top, bottom, left, and right margins.
 * c. The point size of a line.
 * d. If the lines are double-spaced, then double the point size of each character.
